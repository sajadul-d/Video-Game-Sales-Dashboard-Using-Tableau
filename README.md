# Video-Game-Sales-Dashboard-Using-Tableau


• I was interested in exploring the video game industry and understanding the factors that contribute to the success or failure of different video games. This dataset provided a comprehensive list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies, which was perfect for my analysis.

• I created an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize the data and explore different aspects of the video game industry. The dashboard allowed me to analyze the sales of video games across different platforms, genres, and regions, and identify trends and patterns in the data.

• One of the key motivations behind creating this dashboard was to gain insights into the video game industry and understand how different factors such as platform, genre, and region contribute to the success or failure of a video game. The dashboard allowed me to explore these factors and analyze their impact on the sales of video games.

• Overall, creating this interactive data visualization dashboard using the video game sales dataset was a fun and informative project that allowed me to gain insights into the video game industry and explore the data in a meaningful way.
